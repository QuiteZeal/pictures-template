# Secure Nginx with Let's Encrypt
We will use a little tool to do it.

## Get the certbor-auto
```
sudo curl -O https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
```
and mv it to the `/usr/local/bin`
```
sudo mv certbot-auto /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
```
and then, give it permission to read and excute:
```
sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
```

## Install Let's Encrypt
```
sudo /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto --nginx
```
If you use `xxx.conf` as a server block file's configure, the certbot will check it automatic.

### Manual renew
```
sudo /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto renew --dry-run
```
